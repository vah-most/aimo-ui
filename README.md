## What is this?

**Aimo-UI** is a collection of some useful [React][] components which can be used easily in any react application. It's still a work-in-progress and has a long way to get perfect. Also, I accept any suggestions for other useful components to add to this collection.

## Components

These are the components that are part of **aimo-ui** so far:  
| Name | Description | API |
| ------------ | ----------- | --- |
| **AimoPagination** | A fully-controllable table-pagination component | [View][aimo-pagination]|
| **AimoTable** | A powerful table component | [View][aimo-table]|
| **AimoTitledInput** | An input component with sticky label | [View][aimo-titledinput]|
